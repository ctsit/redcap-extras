=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pbchase/redcap-extras.svg?branch=feature/travis)](https://travis-ci.org/pbchase/redcap-extras)

Custom plugins, hooks, DET, and API examples.  This is a public repository for example REDCap code.  It is not warrantied in any way and using this code at your own REDCap installation is at your own risk.  The hope is that together we can improve and build upon what exists here.

There is a separate private repository for the REDCap plugin committee where we are developing best-practice standards.  Perhaps one day these examples can be improved upon and blessed by the committee, but at this time they are use-at-your-own-risk.

If you are interested in joining the REDCap Plugin Committee where you can help contribute to building better extensions, please email the consortium google groups (or contact your REDCap admin if you don't have access to the group).
