Debugging :

Case 1) The default url is http://127.0.0.1:8080/redcap/index.php .If by any chance your Redcap home page url is not this you can give your custom url as the 3rd argument while running the shell script in step 2

	./install <project-name> <data-dictionary-path> <redcap-url>

Case 2) There are chances that even if you have set username and password ,the browser might redirect to homepage if you have an active session . Try to run the script as mentioned in step 2 with username and password as blank.
